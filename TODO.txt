What to do with noncorrelative data? Hard to find any correlation. Especially H1
    Some sides seem to favor an only positive dotproduct or only negative dot product.

Look at the lines list for this interfereometer
Check with how many lines move together with a script
Verical line miss days
make a predicion as to what you would see
smaller comb frequnecy

I want to figure out how to actually replicate my calcuations.

subtract out dot product, then redot to see if the contribution went away. -- dont make the subtraction unless the dot product passes a certain threshold
- look for the stepwise underlying pattern, focus in on a couple of days -- check and see before the bandpass data.
- try and see it with your eyes in the auxiliary channel -- yes you can definitely see something that matches the 9Hz artifact you see in the real data Check

- Next step is to ensure the frequencies and the slopes by figuring out the vertical pixels/second which you can do with image editing software
- Maybe figure out how to do a triangle wave. That would be pretty cool

    Patterns seem to diappear, but here there remains a simple ticking in then beginning.

    Here the comb structure is here, but much richer and subtle. I might do some image analysis on this guy
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_H1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Y_DQ.png
    This one has an even better slope factor.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_H1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EX_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_X_DQ.png
    This one seems to have some horizontal lines at the end there

    This one seems to have lines all over the place. first they appear every two seconds before shifting interestingly later in the run

    Great horizontal lines on this boy.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_H1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EY_ADC_0_12_OUT_DQ.png
    Lines appear coming back in october

    some whisper of horizontal lines here, but without extra image analysis, this may not be the best go. I also do not see any sloping lines. 
    Some horizontal lines even extend all the way across
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_H1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EY_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ.png
    This one has a ton of interesting behavior, from subdivisions early in the year to potential sloping at interesting moments.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_H1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EY_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Z_DQ.png
    potentially interesting behavior, sloping around march 5th



    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_X_DQ.png
    Has that strange one second strong grouping. Interesting how the lines reappear
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-CS_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ.png
    Looked for any kind of sloping behavior, not seeing any. However, same sort of concentration at one second.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_Z_DQ.png
    Strongest signal overall. Best data. Dynamic behavior with several interesting sectors.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EX_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_X_DQ.png
    Much more detailed behavior, 05-20 Jun near end you see "wiggles" in the data.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EX_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ.png
    Check out where it first exhibits the mixed up behavior. There we see that the slope starts out positive but then turns down.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EX_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Z_DQ.png
    same wiggle, same sloping change
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EY_ADC_0_12_OUT_DQ.png
    I need to see if this blocking behavior.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_PEM-EY_MAG_EBAY_SUSRACK_Y_DQ.png
    All three axies are really similar, but here we also see that blocking behavior.
    https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~sherman.thompson/YearDotshare/YearDotshare_L1_CAL-DELTAL_EXTERNAL_DQ_SUS-ETMY_L3_MASTER_OUT_LL_DQ.png
    This one makes me a little concerned because I begin to winder if a lot of what we see are just the artifacts from the channel leaking through the dot product.

    I think the final channel makes me want to do the dot product filtering and produce graphs for each step. Beginning with removing the suspension channel for L1
    

Another thing is that each of the peaks has become significantly wider.



- Weigh the y columns by the dot product darkness


For the dotfilter algorithm:

- Figure out how to determine the accuracy of the data: maybe play with the correlation factors starting small and comparing the
