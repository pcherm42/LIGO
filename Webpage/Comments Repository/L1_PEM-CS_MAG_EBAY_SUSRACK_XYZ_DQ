The first jump we see around valid day 45 corresponds to dates 18-05-2019 through 19-05-2019. This could possibly be due to a power chasis swap related to the following entry:

<br>

The next jump we see is around valid day 125 corresponding to 10-08-2019 through 12-08-2019. 

These are contemperaeous with the following log entries. All three involved swapping out electronics boards possibly near the magnetometer.

Finally, we see a strong downtrend beginning around valid day 175. This corresponds roughly with the period 19-11-2019 through 16-12-2019. However, this is followed by a quick correction between 16-12-2019 and 19-12-2019 around valid day 200.

This correction is contemporaneous with entries:

In CS, EY, and EX MAG_SUSRACK channels (in all three axes), we see a period of low absolute value dot product beginning 16-12-2019 (valid day 200) and ending 22-01-2020 (valid day 240).

This initial drop may be caused by the following entries:
<br>

<a href="https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=50555">"BIO configuration board (D1900166) removed from LSC POP_A (9,45) in ISC-R2-U22 cable ISC_52 reinstalled"</a>
<br><a href="https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=50965">To note, LSC POP_A (9,45), ISC-R2-U22 was reverted back to the cable as there is a difference when the configuration board is used.</a>

<br>

Much of the work on 18-12-2019 is localized to LSC POP_A (9,45), and there is an entry related to LSC POP_A (9,45) on 15-01-2020. Also important to note is that there was a <a href="https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=50557">special emphasis on reaching low noise</a> which seems to be reflected in the data. However, in each of the above cases, the period of low dot product correlation seems to end on 22-01-2020. The following entries are potential explanations:<br>
